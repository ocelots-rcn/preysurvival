# Ecological Interactions Modeling Exercise on Prey Clumping & Density Dependent Survival

Created by Sabrina E. Russo (Biological Sciences) & Glenn Ledder (Math

🚀 [Launch Module](https://mdlama.github.io/Data_Manipulation/)

## Description

In this modeling exercise, you will run several simulations to analyze
the effect of the crowding of prey and density dependent survival on the
proportion of a population of individuals surviving from one time point
to the next. You will turn in your answers to the questions in this
document.

## Built with

[Quarto Live](https://r-wasm.github.io/quarto-live/) - WebAssembly
powered code blocks and exercises for Quarto HTML documents.
[Quarto](https://quarto.org) is the “next generation” of [R
Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). Quarto Live uses
[WebR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/), which facilitates running
R code directly in the browser with no need for a server.
